# 1.BasicProgrammingConcepts

First assignment/project contained four assignments in one...
1.) In this lab, you will write a program that plays the game Rock, Paper, Scissors.
2.) Write a program that asks the user for the name of their dog, and then generates a fake DNA background report on the pet dog.
3.) Make a simple calculator that asks the user for their age. Then calculate the healthy heart rate range for that age, and display it.
4.) Write a static method that takes in an array of ints, adds them together, and returns the result.


******************Rock Paper Scissors Rule and Requirements ***************************
Rules
The rules of the game are as follows:

Each player chooses Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
If both players choose the same thing, the round is a tie.
Otherwise:
Paper wraps Rock to win
Scissors cut Paper to win
Rock breaks Scissors to win

Requirements
This program will be a Java Console Application called RockPaperScissors.

The program first asks the user how many rounds he/she wants to play.
Maximum number of rounds = 10, minimum number of rounds = 1.  If the user asks for something outside this range, the program prints an error message and quits.
If the number of rounds is in range, the program plays that number of rounds.  Each round is played according to the requirements below.
For each round of Rock, Paper, Scissors, the program does the following:
The computer asks the user for his/her choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
Hint: 1 = Rock, 2 = Paper, 3 = Scissors
After the computer asks for the user’s input, the computer randomly chooses Rock, Paper, or Scissors and displays the result of the round (tie, user win, or computer win).
Hint: use the Random class.
The program must keep track of how many rounds are ties, user wins, or computer wins.
Hint: Create three variables to keep track of these items and update them correctly after each round.
The program must print out the number of ties, user wins, and computer wins and declare the overall winner based on who won more rounds.
After all rounds have been played and the winner declared, the program must ask the user if he/she wants to play again.
If the user says No, the program prints out a message saying, “Thanks for playing!” and then exits.
If the user says Yes, the program starts over, asking the user how many rounds he/she would like to play.
